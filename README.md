Introduction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the contemporary world, and predicting heart disease risk factors is crucial for prevention and intervention. The goal of my project was to explore the relationship between different features and the target variable of heart disease and to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify the cases of heart disease. The dataset I used is called "Key Indicators of Heart Disease" from Kaggle,  which contains 300,000+ instances and 18 attributes, of which one is the class attribute (heart disease) and the rest are predictive attributes.

Methodology

I followed several steps and methods to preprocess, analyze, and model the data. First, I cleaned the data by removing any invalid or missing data and defined outliers using statistical methods. Then, I used SMOTE techniques to handle imbalanced data and ensure that my model can generalize well to new data. Next, I used decision  tree to model the data and evaluated its performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve, and AUC metrics. I also used feature selection techniques such as chi-square test and recursive feature elimination to identify the most significant features that affect heart disease risk factors.

Result

My project showed that IBM was the most significant factor that affects heart disease risk factors, followed by age, gender,and  general health,  My model achieved an accuracy of 0.82 on the test data and performed well on all other metrics. 

Discussion

My results have several implications and applications for the field of heart disease prediction or prevention. First, they provide insights into the key factors that affect the risk of developing heart disease and suggest possible interventions or treatments for different groups of people. For example, people with high IBM  should be monitored more closely for heart disease risk factors. Second, they highlight some limitations or challenges in my project such as missing values or multicollinearity that need further investigation or improvement.

Conclusion

My project has contributed to the field of heart disease prediction or prevention by providing valuable insights into the key factors that affect heart disease risk factors and by suggesting possible interventions or treatments for different groups of people. It has also demonstrated the effectiveness of decision tree  and SMOTE techniques in handling imbalanced data and modeling complex relationships between features and target variables. Future research can focus on improving feature selection techniques or using other machine learning algorithms to compare their performance with decision tree.
